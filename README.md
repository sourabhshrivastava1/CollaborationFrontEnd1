# Social Collaboration Project (Collaboration)

This project is based on a collaboration website which involves chatrooms, obtaining specific information, blogs, and all there is to reach a common goal of what the client or the user needs.

One of the main centrepiece in this application is the implementation of **RESTful Web Services**. This gaurantees easy seperation of backend and frontend to be tested explicitly, sending and recieving data by means of HTTP methods and simple URI navigation techniques.

The programming tool used is the **Eclipse IDE** and the programming language used is **Java**, alongside **Oracle Database, Spring and Hibernate frameworks** at it's backend. For testing the inputs and outputs in the **JSON** format at the backend, a tool named **'Postman'** is explicitly used here. The frontend makes use of **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap** and **AngularJS**. The backend of this project is thus combined in a build tool called **Maven**, alongside **JUnit**, all together in a nutshell. Thus, the project is made to run along with a server called **Apache Tomcat**.
